# Chef Kitchen Management System

This section provides a mobile-first interface for kitchen staff to manage incoming orders and food preparation.

## Overview

The chef kitchen management system allows kitchen staff to:

- View and manage incoming orders from customers
- Accept or reject new orders
- Track pending orders and mark items as prepared
- Mark prepared items as served when delivered to customers

## Routes

- `/chef/login` - Chef login page
- `/chef/[restaurantId]/dashboard` - Main dashboard showing new orders
- `/chef/[restaurantId]/pending-orders` - List of accepted orders being prepared

## Components

- `ChefLoginForm` - Login form for kitchen staff
- `ChefNav` - Top navigation bar for the chef interface
- `ChefFooterNav` - Bottom navigation bar with main section links
- `OrderCard` - Display card for new orders with accept/reject options
- `PendingOrdersList` - List of pending orders with preparation tracking
- `PreparedItem` - Component for tracking prepared items waiting to be served

## API Endpoints

- `/api/chef/auth` - Chef authentication
- `/api/chef/orders` - Order management with various actions (accept, reject, prepare, serve)

## Workflow

1. Chef logs in through the login page
2. New orders appear on the dashboard
3. Chef can accept or reject orders
4. Accepted orders move to the pending orders page
5. Chef marks individual items as prepared when ready
6. Chef marks items as served when delivered to customers

## Mock Data

Currently using mock data for development purposes. In production, this would be integrated with the restaurant's backend systems.
